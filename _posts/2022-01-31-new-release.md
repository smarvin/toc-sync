On January 31st, we moved the latest version of the tabcmd command-line utility to version 2.0. This version supports multifactor authentication and allows you to use the utility from remote machines.

We also made this a GitHub project. This means that you can contribute to the code. To install and use tabcmd, download from the [GitHub project](https://github.com/tableau/tabcmd).
